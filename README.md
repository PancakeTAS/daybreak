# Daybreak
Daybreak is p2r3's hardcore minecraft server, where every day the map will reset preserving only the items of players
who have survived. The server runs on a 1.20.1 papermc server with a vanilla world at hardcore difficulty. Survivors are
only those who have logged on at any time of the day and have not died for at least 10 minutes.
